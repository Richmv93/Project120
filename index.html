		<h1>Aloha Murder</h1>
		<pre>
			<p>
Binny howls.
so we can knock them out with one visit
Binny's mouth opens and closes multiple times...like a gasping fish.
Well ... Binny grabs a picnic table, and we sit,
 sizing up our target as we eat.</p>
But seriously, do you think we could tag along,
so we could get there a bit sooner?
there's somebody on the other end who can
It's very precisely targeted

he thought he should say something
and surely this girl was the ideal target
What do you like to drink and why?
I get it, it's know it their fault
If you know what you want
