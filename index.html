Binny howls.
so we can knock them out with one visit
Binny's mouth opens and closes multiple times...like a gasping fish.
Well ... Binny grabs a picnic table, and we sit,
 sizing up our target as we eat.</p>

But seriously, do you think we could tag along,
so we could get there a bit sooner?
there's somebody on the other end who can
It's very precisely targeted </p>

he thought he should say something
and surely this girl was the ideal target
What do you like to drink and why?
I get it, it's know it their fault
If you know what you want </p>
